    <H2>Welcome to your site, Liam</H2>
    <H2>About Me</H2>
    <b>I'm</b> a pokeholic, but I've <br />
    <b>never</b> caught a Mewtwo. I'm <br />
    <b>gonna</b> catch one some day but you'll have to <br />
    <b>give</b> me some time to make it happen. If <br />
    <b>you</b> know how to find him, please reach out to me. I think in level five you go <br />
    <b>up</b> to the professor and then buy a bunch of rare candy. <br />
    <b>I'm</b> going to try that the next time I play, but I got grounded and I'm <br />
    <b>never</b> going to see my switch again, at least I'm not <br />
    <b>gonna</b> see it for another 2 weeks. Then my Mom will <br />
    <b>let</b> me play again. At least if my grades are up. <br />
    <b>You</b> probably already know my sister snuck <br />
    <b>down</b> into my Mom's bedroom and got the Switch! <br />
    <b>I'm</b> probably going to have to steal it from her but I'd <br />
    <b>never</b> think of going through her personal things. I'm <br />
    <b>gonna</b> have to distract her from the switch. Maybe if I <br />
    <b>run</b> through the house she'll join me and as we go <br />
    <b>around</b> the yard she'll get competitive <br />
    <b>and</b> forget all about the game. Of course by then I'll be hotter than the <br />
    <b>desert,</b> but I'll know where she hid the switch and I'll be back to catching them all before <br />
    <b>you</b> know it. <br />
